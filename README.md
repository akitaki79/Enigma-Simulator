## Enigma Simulator

This project is an implementation of the Enigma Machine, a historic cipher device used during World War II. It is based on the assignment provided by Stanford's Nifty Assignments ([link](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2023/roberts-rembold-enigma/)). The program simulates the encryption and decryption process of the Enigma machine, including rotors, reflectors, and plugboard settings.

After cloning the repository, run EnigmaModel.java to view the program. A pop up window should appear with a fully working GUI and encryption logic.
